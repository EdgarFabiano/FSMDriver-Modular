\section{Background}

Drive a car is interesting problem, if human component was removed, because it is not a trivial problem and humans can do easily. There are a many visions to solve this puzzle, for example, approach human-human. Thrun et Al \cite{Thrun06}  show that it is possible to solve this without manual intervention with real car.

But the problem show in this paper is less complex which a controller of real car. Here, expose a virtual problem, run and win a racing car game without a player. In the literature, there are works using many types of solution to drive a autonomous car. This solutions comprehended famous artificial intelligence approaches such as Supervised Methods with NEAT, Finite State Machine with Fuzzy Logic or Tracking and Planning ahead in a racing.

The literature show that is not a good idea choose supervised method in a game-AI. Nevertheless, \cite{learn} using high-level information about the current status of the car and the road ahead was a possible around this trouble. Using too NEAT to replace the player, he demonstrated it is possible develop drivers with performances that in some cases are only 15\% lower than the performance of the fastest driver available in TORCS.
