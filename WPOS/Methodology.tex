\section{Methodology}
	Complete the architecture of the controller, it's time to find a goods parameters for its states.
	
	At the initial moment it was chosen to begin with a exhaustive search, for each and every parameter an initial and maximum value were defined and at each iteration a delta parameter was added. The values of initial, maximum and delta was arbitrary chosen.
	
	
	Each race begins with the car stopped and has three laps. The first battery test was in just one track, but it's clearly necessary to test with a large number of track to produce a general parameter for the pilot.
	
	When the tests reaches the end and the results are generated, it is locate the parameters that makes the pilot run with the minimum total time. At the time, the total time it's the only demand to make a distinction os results.
	
	The very first results emphasize
	this controller achievements: a better performance in more simple tracks, like oval ones, rather than in those with a higher degree of elaboration, like road or dirty tracks.
