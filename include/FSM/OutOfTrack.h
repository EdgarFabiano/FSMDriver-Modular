 * @param max_skidding defines the threshold to start to break to avoid skidding.
 * @param negative_accel_percent dictate how much to release the acceleration pedal to avoid to skidding,
 *                               its defined with the axis speed of car.
 * @param velocity_gear_4 threshold to change the gear to 4.
 * @param velocity_gear_3 threshold to change the gear to 3.
 * @param velocity_gear_2 threshold to change the gear to 2.
 * @param max_return_angle upper boundary to angle of return to track.
